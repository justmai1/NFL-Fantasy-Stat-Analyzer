# NFL-Fantasy-Stat-Analyzer
## My first solo project: Using R-program to gather and analyze individual NFL player data.
Unfortunately, the NFL datasets used are too large for R Shiny, so I can't convert the app into a public server. 
However, the original datasets and manipulated datasets will be uploaded here so you can replicate the app using R-shiny yourself.
